# googleBackground

This is the first browser extension I have made, it simply changes the background wallpaper and a few font features of the google homepage.
It was a fun challenge and fun to learn!

note: I just got setup on my new Linux desktop, please ignore the fact that I added a configuration file for my code formatter!
